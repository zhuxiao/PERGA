SRGA - Sequence Reads Guided Assembler
============================


SRGA is a a novel sequence reads guided de novo assembly approach which adopts greedy-like prediction strategy for assembling reads to contigs and scaffolds. Instead of using single-end reads to construct contig, SRGA uses paired-end reads and different read overlap sizes from O â‰¥ Omax to Omin to resolve the gaps and branches. Moreover, by constructing a decision model using machine learning approach based on branch features, SRGA can determine the correct extension in 99.7% of cases. SRGA will also try to extend the contigs by all feasible nucleotides and determine if these multiple extensions due to sequencing errors or repeats by using looking ahead technology.



-------------
Compiling SRGA

You can generate the binary file by typing:
./autogen.sh

and the binary files will be output into the folder 'bin'.
